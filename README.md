# CinemaCatalog
In this project, I built a website inspired by IMDB that allows users to create and manage a personal playlist of movies they have watched. The application is developed using Python, Flask, and Jinja2 on the backend, with HTML/CSS for the frontend and MongoDB as the database. It demonstrates core concepts of web development, user interaction, and database-driven application design.

## Purpose
I developed this project to strengthen my application development skills and deepen my understanding of Python-based APIs and web technologies. As a software developer, I wanted to explore practical backend–frontend integration while refining my overall development workflow. I hope this project not only showcases my work but also inspires you to explore, learn, and build something of your own.
